    # Overview
    Use this API to send structured data to a patients GP record. You can send data related to the patient for the following areas
    - medications
    - encounters
    - observations
    
    For the first iteration of this API, only a pharmacy use-case has been approved. Common use cases for this capability include:

    - a pharmacy informing the GP that a patient has been prescribed antibiotics
    - a pharmacy informing a GP that a patient has had their blood pressure checked
    

    # Who can use this API
    This API can be used by developers of clinical systems who have the need to update a patients GP record.
   
    Make sure you have a valid use case before you go too far with your development. To do this, contact us.
    You must do this before you can go live (see 'Onboarding' below).
    ## Prerequisites
    ### Technical 
    
    You must:
    
    - have access to the [Health and Social Care Network (HCSN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network)
     - be [Personal Demographics Service(PDS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/demographics) compliant or capable of performing a PDS search to obtain the patients registered GP
     - be [Spine Directory Service (SDS)](https://developer.nhs.uk/apis/gpconnect-0-5-0/integration_spine_directory_service.html) compliant to be able to obtain the endpoint of the registered GP
    ### Information governance (IG)
     You must:
     - be compliant with the GP Connect Direct Care API Information Governance Model.
     - be using the GP Connect APIs for direct care purposes for NHS patients in England
     
     ### Clinical safety
    You must:
    - have a clinical safety officer (CSO) who is responsible for DCB0129 and, if necessary, DCB0160. For more on clinical risk management, visit Clinical risk management standards.
    If you are confident that you can meet the prerequisites, contact us to express your interest. See 'Onboarding' below.
    # Related APIs
      The following APIs are related to this API:
      - [GP Connect Access Record: Structured - FHIR API](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/gp-connect-access-record-structured-fhir) - retrieve structured information from a patient's GP practice record.

    # API status and roadmap
    This API is in [development](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses).
    # Service level
    This API is a silver service, meaning it is operational 24 x 7 x 365 but only supported during business hours (8am to 6pm), Monday to Friday excluding bank holidays.
    For more details, see [service levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).
    # Technology
    This is a FHIR API which conforms to the FHIR global standard for health care data exchange. Specifically, it is aligned with the GP Connect Data Model which is a FHIR STU3 representation.  
    
    The API requires the provider to send a HTTP request containing a FHIR payload to the provider endpoint. 
    
    The payload will contain clinical information about the patient - for example, medications,  encounters and observations.
    For more details, see [Update Record implementation guide](https://simplifier.net/guide/gp-connect-update-record?version=current) to assist with your development
    # Network access
    You can access this API via the [Health and Social Care Network](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).
    
    The API is not currently available over the internet, but we plan to enable public internet access in the future.
    For more details, see [Network access for APIs.](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis)
    # Security and authorisation
    ## Security
    Access to the GP Connect APIs is controlled and protected by the Spine Secure Proxy (SSP), a forward HTTP proxy.

    It provides a single security point for both authentication and authorisation for consuming systems. Additional responsibilities include auditing of requests, checking data sharing agreements and transaction logging.

    All HTTP communications are secured using TLS MA. This includes both legs of the request, from consumer system to the proxy and then from the proxy to provider system.

    ## Authorisation
    Authorisation takes place in two locations: 
    
    - the consumer system
    - the SSP
    
    The consumer system must have local RBAC in place and restrict GP Connect APIs to authorised users. With each request, a JSON Web Token (JWT) must be included with the following information:
    -  details of users, including role
    -  where smartcards are used in the consumer system, including SDS user and role IDs
    - details of the consumer system
    - details of the consumerâ€™s organisation, including ODS code
    
    The information in the JWT is retained for audit purposes.

    The SSP checks data-sharing agreements to ensure that the consumer system is authorised to communicate with the provider system.

    # Environments and testing

    # Onboarding
    
    This API is currently not available for onboarding
    
    ## Expressing an interest

    If you meet the prerequisites and have a product that can integrate with GP Connect, you should express an interest with us by submitting a use case. 
    
    The main purpose of the use case is to help us understand how you plan to use GP Connect APIs and the business issue you are looking to address. 
    
    You should email your use case to us at gpconnect@nhs.net. Your use case should include the following information as a minimum:
    - the business problem you are intending to solve using GP Connect
    - how GP Connect will be used in practice to benefit patients and staff
    - which of the GP Connect products you will use to benefit patients and staff
    - any end user organisations you are currently working with
    - who your clinical safety officer is and, where available, your clinical risk management process documentation
    
    ## Consumer assurance process
    
    Once we approve your use case, we support you through the assurance process to go live. We will discuss the assurance process and artefacts with you to hel you understand our requirements
    
    Start your development work within 6 months of use case approval. If you miss this date, a review or new submission of the use case will be required. Changes or additional development will also require a review or new use case submission. 
    
    # Errors
    
    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:

    - 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action

    - 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application

    - 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server
